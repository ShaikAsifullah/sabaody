# Sabaody

A distributed implementation of the island model for parameter fitting of dynamical systems biology models. Uses [Spark (on Python)](https://spark.apache.org/) for distributed computing, [pygmo2](https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/) for its various optimization algorithms, and the [Tellurium environment](http://tellurium.analogmachine.org/) for model simulation.
